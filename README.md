## FAQ

### Will exist a pack of scripts for this framework?

Yes, we are working on it!

### Why use it instead of others?

Depends on your like, we developed it for efficiency and for making an optimized framework!

### How it is different?

Well, as we started to work, we thought that we need something fast, robust and easy to use, so we made it by ESX Framework Proxy and Tunnel linking and combining them with oldvRP modules! 
We thought that the developers need something restartable, so we made it restartable.
And many features...

### Why it doesn't have any menu or GUI?

We made it for being reusable, so developers can now create their GUIs or menu!

### Will be there any menu or GUI?

There is a pack of scripts in development, when will be published will contain menus, commands and a usable phone!

### Can be used as a starter framework?

Yes, it can be, but we are asking creators to not forget about our credits.
